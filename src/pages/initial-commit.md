For the past year now I've had it on my list to rebuild my personal website and start blogging. But nope I keep making excuses, I procrastinate around the idea of actually making it happen.

What technology stack should I use for this? middleman? hugo? gatsby? 🤔

Gatsby looks cool, I’ve built a number of sites with middleman before and also I kinda want to learn React... I mean all the cool kids are using it, why not 🤷🏾‍♂️

I install the necessary tools,  scaffold new project, go through the project structure... already thinking about what headless CMS I want to use, don’t know why I think I need one, yet I’m looking them up and comparing. I end up burning a good chunk of my time doing that until I eventually give up for the day.

A few months later, I’m back at it. This time around the major question is around the design... What will it look like? How many pages should I have?

Draw a couple of wireframes... Learn how to use sketchapp, because why not, I also want to learn how to design cool stuff. I eventually get lost in all this learning and build nothing.

And this has been going on, and on, and on for over a year now.

That ends today though... I’ve decided to take an incremental approach to get this done. Being a software engineer, practising agile at work, you’d think I would be able to apply all of that knowledge to other areas 🤨

At this point, I don’t care how many pages the site will initially ship with... Don’t care how ugly it looks like. I’m gonna ship it as is, then every time I make a change, I’ll blog about it (Yay me, another thing I’ve been meaning to do for a while now... but you know, there’s always an excuse) - This post might even be the only thing to go live for now, but that’s okay 🙂

The time will indeed never be right, we fail to achieve a number of things in life because we’re always waiting/looking for that perfect moment. Stop waiting, and start something, start somewhere, doesn’t matter how small it is, #justStart.

Till next time 👋🏾
