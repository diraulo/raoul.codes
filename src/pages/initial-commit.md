For the past year now i’ve had it on my list to rebuild my personal website, and start blogging. But nope i keep making excuses, I procrastinate around the idea of actually making it happen.

What technology stack should I use for this? middleman? hugo? gatsby? 🤔

Gatsby looks cool, i’ve built a number of sites with middleman before and also I kinda want to learn React... I mean all the cool kids are using it, why not 🤷🏾‍♂️

I install the necessary tools,  scaffold new project, go through the project structure... already thinking about what headless CMS I want to use, don’t know why I think I need one, yet i’m looking them up and comparing. I end up burning a good chunk of my time doing that until i eventually give up for the day.

Few months later, i’m back at it. This time around the major question is around the design... What will it look like? How many pages should I have?

Draw a couple of wireframes... Learn how to use sketchapp, because why not, I also want to learn how to design cool stuff. I eventually get lost in all this learning and builds nothing.

And this has been going on, and on, and on for over a year now.

That ends today though... I’ve decided to take an incremental approach to getting this done. Being a software engineer, practicing agile at work, you’d think I would be able to apply all of that knowledge to other areas 🤨

At this point, I don’t care how many pages the site will initially ship with... Don’t care how ugly it looks like. I’m gonna ship it as is, then every time I make a change, i’ll blog about it (Yay me, another thing i’ve been meaning to do for a while now... but you know, there’s always an excuse) - This post might even be the only thing to go live for now, but that’s okay 🙂

The time will indeed never be right, we fail to achieve a number of things in life because we’re always waiting/looking for that perfect moment. Stop waiting, and start  something, start somewhere, doesn’t matter how small it is, #justStart.

Till next time 👋🏾
